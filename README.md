# Face and Eye Detection using OpenCV

This Python script uses OpenCV to perform real-time face and eye detection through Haar cascades. It captures video from your webcam and outlines detected faces and eyes in rectangles.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system.
- OpenCV library installed. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Getting Started

Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChanchalBawara/Face-Eye-Detector.git
cd Face-Eye-Detector
```

Run the Script:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage
- The script will activate your webcam and display the live feed.
- Detected faces will be outlined in red rectangles, and eyes within those faces will be outlined in purple rectangles.
- To exit the program, press the "x" key.

## Customization
Feel free to experiment with different Haar cascade XML files for face and eye detection based on your requirements.
